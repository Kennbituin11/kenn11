Batulao in Batangas Philippines gives hikers a decent challenge and extremely scenic trails of rolling slopes and green grasslands. Before reaching the summit, you will have to pass through several mini-peaks which takes roughly four hours to arrive. For hikers in it for the stunning views and wanting to take their time, there are campsites along the trail to relax and spend the night. You see, Batangas tourism is not just about beaches.
